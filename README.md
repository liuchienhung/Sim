# Sim
Simulator of RC Helicopter.

Same simulators:
1) Phoenix RC sim
2) Real Flight
3) Aerofly
4) Heli-next
5) Heli-x

All of them have benefits and limitations. No simulators on market* have power loss from cyclic, some simulators do not simulate rotor overspeed. I tried to make simulatior with improved phisics. 

Build folde - application folder with executable files.
